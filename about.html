        		<h1>About me:</h1>
				<p>I grew up in a small town in southern New Jersey called Egg Harbor Township.
				   After getting my BS degree in Materials Science and Engineering from Rutgers,
				   I went to UC Irvine for graduate school to study molecular simulations in a Ph.D. program
				   . I really enjoyed the coding aspect of this project, so I decided to try my luck in the tech industry.<br><br>

				   I decided to leave grad school with my MS in Mechanical Engineering. After visiting home for a couple of weeks, I decided to take a risk and move out to Seattle, WA with nothing but my car. I stayed at an AirBNB for 9 days and told myself if I couln't find permanent housing there, then I would just drive home. Fortunately, I found permanent housing in an 11-bedroom house in the U-District. I lived in the basement and worked as a drug store cashier for a bit to make money. I met great people there and it was one of the greatest adventures I've had.<br><br>

				   I eventually became a process technician at a nearby materials testing lab. I moved into my first (micro) studio apartment after accepting this job. My bed folded into the wall and my feet almost touched my oven while I slept. During my time as a materials tester, I started pursuing my own coding projects and networking like crazy. It was a lot of fun to get out and see what others are working on and what inspired them.<br><br> 

				   After working at the lab for a year, I picked up a job as a web applications developer down in Eugene, OR. I've been here since March 2018 and have developed my core Java and JavaScript skills quite a bit. The position is only temporary, but I am always excited for the next adventure.
